    "1. You got an internship at The Economist and your first task is to publish an article which includes the statements made by politicians. You are given a text out of quotes from the media, each sentence contains a quote and the author of this statement. Create a dictionary in which the key is the author's name (a string with first and last name), and the value is the author's quote. You are not allowed to create a new dictionary manually (copy-paste, etc.). Your code should transform a list with given strings into a dictionary mentioned above. You can use additional data structures (for example, to store only the names of politicians in it) if it helps you to get to the final dictionary. \n",
